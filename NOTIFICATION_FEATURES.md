## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Files Added:
- `lib/sounds.ts` - Sound management system
- `components/Toast.tsx` - Toast notification component
- `lib/hooks/useUnreadCount.ts` - Badge counter logic

### Files Modified:
- `app/swipe/page.tsx` - Added sounds, toasts, badge
- `app/chat/[matchId]/page.tsx` - Added message sounds and toasts

### How Sounds Work:
```typescript
import { playSound } from '@/lib/sounds'

// Play a sound
playSound('match')   // Match celebration
playSound('message') // Message notification
playSound('swipe')   // Swipe feedback
```

### How Toasts Work:
```typescript
import Toast from '@/components/Toast'

<Toast
  show={showToast}
  message="You liked John"
  icon="❤️"
  duration={2000}
  onClose={() => setShowToast(false)}
/>
```

### How Badge Works:
```typescript
import { useUnreadCount } from '@/lib/hooks/useUnreadCount'

const unreadCount = useUnreadCount(userId)

{unreadCount > 0 && (
  <span className="badge">{unreadCount}</span>
)}
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Sound Volume:
Edit `lib/sounds.ts`:
```typescript
gainNode.gain.setValueAtTime(0.15, ...) // 0.0 to 1.0
```

### Change Toast Duration:
```typescript
<Toast duration={3000} /> // milliseconds
```

### Change Badge Update Frequency:
Edit `lib/hooks/useUnreadCount.ts`:
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(checkUnreadMessages, 10000) // ms
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Sounds too loud?** Adjust your system volume or edit the gain values in `lib/sounds.ts`

2. **Badge not updating?** It polls every 10 seconds. Wait a bit or refresh the page.

3. **Toast disappearing too fast?** Increase the `duration` prop

4. **Want to disable sounds?** Add a settings toggle using `getSoundManager().disable()`
